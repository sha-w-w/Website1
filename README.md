This is a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-starters/) starter project.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

You can run the Gatsby starter project using Wasmer (check out the [install guide](https://docs.wasmer.io/install)):

```bash
npm run build
wasmer run . -- --port=3000
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Deploy on Wasmer Edge

The easiest way to deploy your Gatsby app is to use the [Wasmer Edge](https://wasmer.io/products/edge).

Live example: https://wasmer-edge-gatsby-sample.wasmer.app/

First, you'll need to run `npm run build`, and then, to deploy to Wasmer Edge:

```bash
wasmer deploy
```


## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a typical Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

1.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

1.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

1.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

1.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

1.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

1.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-ssr/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

1.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

1.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

1.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
